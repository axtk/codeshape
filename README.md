# codeshape

Code-style rules for *eslint*, *typescript-eslint*, and *stylelint*

- Install: `npm i -D codeshape`
- Import rulesets from `codeshape/rules` or complete configs from `codeshape/configs`, or run `npx codeshape` for quick linting.

## Features

- consistent spacing for arrays and objects

as in the mathematical notation of vectors and set elements: *(x, y, z)*, *{x, y, z}*

```ts
[x, y, z]
{x, y, z}
{x: 0, y: 1, z: -1}

import {x} from './x';
```

- Stroustrup identation style

`else` and `catch` on the next line after `}` allow for comments covering the entire following block to be consistently located above the block

```ts
// this is a sample comment to the condition
if (condition) {
    // ...
}
// another comment
else if (otherCondition) {
    // ...
}
// yet another comment
else {
    // ...
}
```

- keywords are spaced, `function()` is not

as in the mathematical notation

`function(params)`, `setCustomValue(value)` as in *f(x)*, no space before the bracket

`if (x)`, `for (let i...)`, `while (ok)` as in regular logical statements, with a space before the conditional expression

- arrow function brackets only when necessary

`const f = x => x + 10;` (akin to mapping a scalar *x*, normally unbracketed)

`const g = (x, y) => x + y - 10;` (akin to mapping a vector *(x, y)*, normally bracketed)

- preferring `let` over `const`

By [definition](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/const), `const` is for values that *can't be redeclared*, rather than for values that *are not reassigned*. `const` is for values that are *intended* to be unchanged (like *Ï€*), while `let` is for any other variables whether they turn out to be changed or not.
